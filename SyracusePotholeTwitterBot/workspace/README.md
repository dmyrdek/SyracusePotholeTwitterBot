This project was made for the 2017 Upstate NY hackathon, and was created by Doug Myrdek, Brian Emigholz and Cedric Hansen.

This program takes open data from the Syracuse City government, and tweets out the location, and district of potholes that have been filled int the past 24 hours, and tweets at a rate of 1 tweet per minute . For the purpose of our Hackathon presenation, we tweet out the locations of the filled potholes from the past 10 days, again, at tweets once per minute.
In "real life" the program would be set up to run once everyday at 12, and will tweet out location of fixed potholes in the past 24 hours (Using CronJob scheduler)
