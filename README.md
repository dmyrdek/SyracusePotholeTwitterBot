# SyracusePotholeTwitterBot

First Place winner in the Syracuse Hack-a-ton Cuse Database Category!

https://twitter.com/cusepotholes

This program takes open data from the Syracuse City government, and tweets out the location, and district of potholes that have been filled in the past 24 hours, and tweets at a rate of 1 tweet per minute. For the purpose of our Hackathon presentation, we tweet out the locations of the filled potholes from the past 10 days, again, at tweets once per minute. In "real life" the program would be set up to run once every day at 12, and will tweet out location of fixed potholes in the past 24 hours (Using CronJob scheduler)
